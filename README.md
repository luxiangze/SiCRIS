# SiCRIS: Silkworm integrated CRISPR analysis

SiCRIS is a specialized toolkit designed for the analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 screening libraries in Bombyx mori (silkworm). It provides a streamlined pipeline for processing sequencing reads, quantifying gRNA abundances, performing differential analysis, and identifying candidate target genes with functional relevance.

## Features
- Optimized for Bombyx mori genome and gRNA libraries
- High-throughput read count extraction and normalization
- Statistical analysis for screening experiments (e.g., positive/negative selection)
- Visualization tools for gRNA and gene-level enrichment
- Customizable parameters and modular workflow

## Use Cases
- Genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening in silkworm
- Functional genomics studies in lepidopteran insects
- Identification of essential genes under specific conditions
